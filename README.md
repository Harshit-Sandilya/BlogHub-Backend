# BlogHub : Backend Repository

The idea is to create a working backend where the user can post his own blogs. The blogs can be either text or markdown (if text it would be converted into markdown). And the user can post blogs either with his sign or anomysouly. The flow is from index.js->server.js->routes. The models contain the supporting models for diffrent compnents such as users and blogs. We are giving the chance of having a cover image in text mode and multiple images in markdown with one on the server and other refrenced.

The stack is HTML,CSS,JS in the frontend and Node and express in the backend. Its just a personal project to practise concept of backend and frontend. The frontend is in another repository. If anyone wants to contribute to the project, feel free to do so.

## To do

- Implement Contact (Preferably Nodemailer)
- User Specific Blogs
- Validation for user in registration and user model
- Password checking and appropriate response
